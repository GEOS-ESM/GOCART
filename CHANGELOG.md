## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-17

This release of GOCART is aimed at moving GOCART from GEOSchem_GridComp to its own repository. At the moment the only code here that is verified as correct is the "GOCART Legacy" code which is code that came from GEOSchem_GridComp v1.4.3.

To use this release, you need to use GEOSchem_GridComp v1.4.4 which has the changes necessary to move GOCART Legacy to this separate repository.

Identical in code to v1.0.0-beta.1
 
## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2021-03-01

### Changed

- Pull in updates from `develop`. In GEOSgcm setup, this is zero-diff for both GOCART actual and climatological (e.g., not GOCART2G).

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2021-02-23

### Added

- Added GOCART legacy source code which is been pulled out of the GEOSchem_GridComp v1.4.2.

## [0.9.1] - 2020-09-29

### Changed

- Switched StrTemplate from using the one provided by `GMAO_MPEU` to one provided by `MAPL`
